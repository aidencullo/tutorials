# today we will be learning about numbers in python!

# before we learn about number, we need to learn about variables

# this is a variables that has a value of 0

jean = 0

# variables can be almost anything, here is another variable named 'jordan' with the value with the value 1

jordan = 1

# variables can also have string values (text)

# this is a variables that has a value of "hello"

greeting = "hello"

# Let's do an exercise!
