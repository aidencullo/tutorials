### TOPIC: Booleans I

# previously we discussed the number datatype, now we will introduce another datatype called a Boolean

# While a number has many possible values, a Boolean has only two, True or False

# let's set variable isBlue to True and isRed to False

isBlue = True
isRed = False

print(isBlue)
print(isRed)

# but why do we have booleans?

# with two booleans we can build another boolean using the `and` keyword

# `and` evaluates to True only if both values are true

true_and_true = True and True

# let's print this and we should see True

print(true_and_true)
